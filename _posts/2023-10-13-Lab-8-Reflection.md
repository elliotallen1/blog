The code for my Razor Application is in my [csci340lab8 repository](https://github.com/elliotallen1/csci340lab8) on GitHub.

The tutorial was rather straight forward and easy to follow. I was able to follow along without running into too many complications. At first, I was getting a bunch of weird errors that I have never seen before, but after looking through stack exchange for a minute, I was able to find out what I needed to do to fix the errors.

Translating the tutorial was also not too difficult; however, I did run into an issue that set me back a while. When typing in the commands, I accidentally gave two things the same name. This crossed some wires in the code, and it was very difficult to find what was wrong. I figured that the name being the same was the issue, but I could not figure out how to fix it because everything was jumbled up. Luckily, I was not too far in to the project, so I just restarted and did not make the same mistake again. 

Working with Jekyll and working with Razor did not feel all too different to me. They both came with a lot of folders and files that I had no navigate through and understand before I could get started on my work. One big difference, though, is that I could only look at the website locally using Razor. I feel confident in my ability to make another Razor application. I may need to peak back at the tutorial occasionally, but I think I will be able to handle doing most of it on my own.
