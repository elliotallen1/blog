I was in charge of creating the student side of the Moqup for our presentation. This includes making the table where their forms will be displayed as well as the bar at the top displaying the student's progress. After our presentations in class, we decided we should step away from the drop-down menus on the admin side, and instead move over to a table displaying all of the students. This will make the admin side much more readible, and they will be able to view all the students instead of having to go through a bunch of menus.

Going forward, I will primarily be in charge of the HTML/CSS for our final project. Our team has another meeting on Monday where we will discuss our roles and hopefully get started on a demo to present to our client. I do not anticipate running into too many complications with styling because there is not a ton of ways to majorly mess anything up on the front end. I look forward to getting feedback on our Moqup and demo from our client so that we can make the best website for their needs.
