Building this blog is all very new to me. For other assignments in this class, we have started completely from [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). In this assignment, though, we were working with an existing template. It was interesting to see how all of these parts fit together and interact. One part that I was stuck on for a while was trying to get the text in the header to change colors. I realized I needed to use the [classes](https://sites.google.com/view/classroom-workspace/login) instead of just trying to change the elements in CSS. I also had to mark it as !important in order for it to work. This is also my first time using Markdown. Below are the logos for Sass and Markdown:
