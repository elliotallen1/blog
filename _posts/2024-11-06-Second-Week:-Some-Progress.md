Okay so hi again blog! This week was my second week at Disco Tray Studios, and honestly, it was kind of a stinker...

The issues with the SOS Resources app remained and I was not able to get any progress done. I have searched all over the internet for possible fixes to the issue, but I have been unable to find anything. I can tell there is an issue with my certificate to test locally, but beyond that, I do not know anything. 

I was finally able to get an error message, though:

    ArgumentException: IDW10109: No credential could be loaded. This can happen when certificates passed to the configuration have expired or can't be loaded and the code isn't running on Azure to be able to use Managed Identity, Pod Identity etc. Details: 
    (Parameter 'clientCredentials')

The internet is not very helpful for this error... 

I have done almost everything I can think to do. Hopefully, the internet will throw something up at me soon that I can work with. In the meantime, I am going to try to delete and redownload any software required for this project. 

I hope to get my issues figured out this week. Then I can finally get started on this project!
