Our goal for this project was to create a web application that acted as a place for students to come in and add music event attendances in order to reach the amount of attendances required by the Music Department. The department had a system in place to complete very goal, but it was very convoluted and a nightmare to keep up with. There were also many flaws in the old system. For example, students could not see how many attendances they had; they could only submit them. This new system will be much better for both the Music Department and the students using it.

One very important skill needed for this project was client communication. The client had a goal that they wanted, but it was up to us to realize that goal. This meant that there needed to be constant communication between our partner and us in order to create the finished product that they sought out. The goal of client communication was given to one of our team members, and he was very effective in this role. He made this challenge of client communication much easier for us.

I think that the strategies our client used to bring about change were highly successful. They recognized the need for a more efficient method to manage student attendance records and sought our assistance in developing an app for that purpose. This app effectively streamlines the cumbersome process of recording and reviewing attendance logs for both administrators and students. Therefore, the client's approach in requesting this app proved to be a very successful way to make this change.

This project did not do much to change any of my personal values or beliefs, but it did change how I percieved myself as a student and a team member. At first, I was worried that I was not going to be able to do a lot of what was asked of me. After this project, I found out that maybe I can hang with the other comp sci majors, and that I can be an essential part of the teaam.
