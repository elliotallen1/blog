Setting up this blog was not all too bad. All of this is new to me, but everything makes sense to me so far. The only part that was a struggle was downloading Ruby. It took me probably around 3 hours to get it installed. It was very frustrating because it felt like there was nothing that I could do to get it working. After scrolling through [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) for a while, I was finally able to get it set up. Here is a list of all of the Computer Science courses I have taken:
* CSCI 150
* CSCI 151
* MATH 240
* CSCI 340 (currently taking)
* CSCI 382 (currently taking)
