The code for my Entity Framework is in my [csci340lab9 repository](https://github.com/elliotallen1/csci340lab9) on GitHub.

This tutorial was a lot more than what I was expecting, and it was much more difficult than the Razor Pages tutorial. I found myself confused a lot in this tutorial. The tutorial would tell you to make some changes and test it, but the program would not run until you added something later in the tutorial. This led me to believe there was something wrong with what I had just added. This was not the case, and it made me try to debug an issue that was not even there. 

I also ran into an issue with migrations. I kept running into this error: 'SQLite Error 10: 'disk I/O error'.'. I tried fixing this one error for a few hours with no luck. I made a run to Taco Bell, came back, and then for some reason the issue just resolved itself. I still have no idea what was wrong, but that was extremely frustrating to deal with.

I feel moderately prepared to crate the team project now. The tutorial was very helpful, but I just feel like there is still much more to do for the project that is outside the scope of the tutorial. We will still need to figure out how to do log-ins, as well as handle an Approve/Disaprove feature for each submission.
