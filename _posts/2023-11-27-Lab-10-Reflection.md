For Lab 10, we were assigned the task of deploying a Razor Pages application using Azure. This lab was rather simple, and we were able to get it done in one sitting in the library with the whole group. The hardest part of this lab was the initial set up. It seemed as if there was an issue with every single thing that we were trying to do. We ended up having to do a lot of things manually, but after the initial setup, the tutorial was pretty simple to follow. 

Dividing up the work on this lab was pretty simple. I was in charge of the verification strings and sample code, while Ryan initialized everything and Mason set up the database. Communication with the team was not difficult because we were all sitting right in front of each other. We also did not run into any issues all working on the same code because we did it all on Ryan's laptop.

We were able to get the [website](http://msdocs-core-sql-tutorial-ram.azurewebsites.net) up!
